Instructions to run the code: 

1. Ensure you have downloaded the necessary packages. 
2. Place the files in a directory with the following structure:

Intended Directory -> CSV files
                   -> Python files
            
   Do not change the structure since the way the csv files are read requires the exact structure. 
3. After that, you may run the code by typing python3 main.py using a terminal. This will run the code in generate_profile, activity_eval
   and extra_credit
